# Intermediate-Python

IMPORTANT: If you are teaching this for the first time, please set up a meeting with Dave Wade-Stein prior to teaching so you understand the difficulties in delivering this course.

A successful delivery of this course involves you understanding

1. the backgrounds of the students in the class
1. that there is deliberately more material that you will likely get through
 
During the "Magic Hour", find out the backgrounds of the students and plan accordingly. Unfortunately,
in more than one case, the students were nowhere near the intermediate level. As the instructor, you
need to be prepared for a true intermediate course (i.e., this material), an introductory course, or
a mix of the two.

In order for students to be prepared for this course, they should have familiarity with Python and have
been using it for a while. If they've only been scripting, i.e., using Python for automation a la DevOps,
they are unlikely to be properly prepared for this course.

The biggest difficulty is that it is likely that not all students will have the same background. This is
of course true in *any* course, not just this one.

Once you've assessed the student backgrounds, you can make a recommendation to the class. 

"This course begins with a review of basic Python concepts. How much time we spend on that depends on the
backgrounds of the students and the questions that arise during the review. Given that most of you have a
basic understanding of Python and tend to use Python in a scripting/DevOps background, I want to spend a
little extra time on that first section to be sure we all have a common foundation."

The Multithreading/Multiprocessing unit should be updated with more modern ways
of doing concurrency in Python.
