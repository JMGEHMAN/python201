    "Welcome to the final afternoon.  Today's most important exercise is brainstorming where you can use you new skills.  Talk with your breakout group and come up with at least 3 ideas as a group of how you could use your new python skills at NM.  send them to me so that I can see them and also please post them to your NM class slack so others can see them too. Remember that the only way to really learn a computer language is with your fingers, so find a project you might want to do.   \n",

If you don't want to use this example but you would prefer to use something more work related, go ahead.  Some work related project ideas are: commenting on Jira tickets to say you are working on them or they are relevant to your group, posting a message to Slack when you commit code, or following all gitlab issues that mention a certain class, file or term. Regardless of the project you choose:\n",
